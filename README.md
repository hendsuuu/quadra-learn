# QuadraLearn

__QuadraLearn__ is a web-based interactive learning media for quadratic function topic in grade X using the tutorial method (_Media Pembelajaran Interaktif Berbasis Web Pada Materi Fungsi Kuadrat Kelas X Dengan Metode Tutorial_).

## Background

In the field of Education, technology has a significant impact on knowledge, where students are taught about natural phenomena and facts through this technology (Maritsa et al., 2021). In this regard, technology can be a very effective and efficient medium to use as support in the learning process to make it more engaging. In the field of Education, particularly in the subject of mathematics, technology can play a role in helping students become more active and creative during the learning process.

The subject of Mathematics serves as the foundation for all knowledge, development, and technology. Therefore, mathematics is a compulsory subject in both schools and universities. Learning mathematics is inseparable from the issue of application. In learning mathematics, students need to develop and master critical thinking skills when facing various problems. They must be able to think logically when making decisions about what they believe and do (Shara et al., 2019).

One of the topics in mathematics education is quadratic function. In this topic, students are required to determine the optimum value of quadratic functions, sketch quadratic function graphs, explain the influence of the coefficient x2 on quadratic functions, identify the axis of symmetry of quadratic function graphs, explain the relationship between the discriminant value and the intersection points of quadratic functions with the x-axis, determine quadratic functions if their graphs are known, present contextual problems in the form of quadratic functions, and solve them. Based on research at SMA Negeri 1 Ulu Moro'o, it was found that students still have difficulty understanding quadratic function materials, from determining quadratic function graphs, identifying quadratic function graphs, to determining quadratic functions if their graphs are known. Therefore, creating mathematics learning media with quadratic function material can help students understand the material more easily (Gulo et al., 2021).

Learning media can be considered as crucial in the learning process. It helps teachers deliver the material and makes it easier for students to understand. The use of media in learning processes can stimulate curiosity, student interest, and learning outcomes. It also provides motivation and stimulation in learning activities. Learning media has evolved rapidly, especially technology-based learning media. Various learning media are now packaged in a modern and unique way, both in hardware such as pocket books, student worksheets, and in software such as applications or websites packaged in an interactive format.

The development of interactive learning media can help students understand the taught material because it involves two-way communication. Therefore, interactive learning media can be developed through the web. Web-based learning is a learning method that utilizes internet technology, where web pages provide learning materials that can be accessed anytime and anywhere by students. Thus, the use of interactive web-based learning media can reduce static environments, create effective and engaging interactive learning processes, and stimulate student motivation (Munawarah et al., 2021).

One of the methods used in interactive learning media is the tutorial method. The tutorial method involves delivering the material in a tutorial manner. This method has the characteristics of being programmed into the computer as instructional material, allowing students to respond while learning specific material, evaluating students' answers by the learning program on the computer, and requiring students to repeat or continue to the next learning activity if they do not understand the previous material (Kustandi & Sutjipto, 2013) (Rafianti et al., 2018).

Based on the background above, it is evident that technology plays a crucial role in education, especially in mathematics subjects, where technology can be instrumental in quadratic function topics, which often pose difficulties for students. By using interactive learning media and employing the tutorial method for quadratic functions, researchers hope that students will be able to understand quadratic functions more easily because the material is structured within the learning media. Therefore, the researcher intends to conduct research on "Media Pembelajaran Interaktif Berbasis Web Pada Materi Fungsi Kuadrat Kelas X Dengan Metode Tutorial" or __QuadraLearn__.
